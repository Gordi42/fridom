Tutorials
=========

The tutorials are organized into two main chapters: using models and creating models. The first chapter covers how to use the built-in models in FRIDOM, while the second chapter explains how to create custom models. The tutorials are designed to be followed in order, as they build on each other.
Finally, the more tutorials chapter contains additional tutorials that do not fit into the other two categories.
