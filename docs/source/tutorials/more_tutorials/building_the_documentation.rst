Building the documentation
==========================

Whenever a new commit is pushed on github to the main branch, the documentation is automatically built and deployed to readthedocs. However, if you want to build the documentation locally, for example to preview changes before pushing them, you can do so by following this guide.

Before we start building the documentation, it makes sense to take a look at the file structure of this documentation.
