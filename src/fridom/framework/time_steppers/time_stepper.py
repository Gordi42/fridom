class TimeStepper(fr.modules.Module):
    """
    Base class for all time steppers.
    
    Description
    -----------
    Required methods:
    1. `__init__(self, ...) -> None`: The constructor only takes keyword
    argument which are stored as attributes. Always call the parent constructor
    with `super().__init__(name, **kwargs)`.
    2. `update(self, mz: ModelState) -> None`: This method is called by the
    model at each time step. It should update the model state `mz` to the next
    time level. Make sure to wrap the method with the `@update_module` decorator
    from the `Module` class.

    Optional methods:
    1. `start(self) -> None`: This method is called by the model before the
    time stepping starts. It can be used to initialize variables or allocate
    memory. Make sure to wrap the method with the `@start_module` decorator from
    the `Module` class.
    2. `stop(self) -> None`: This method is called by the model after the time
    stepping has finished. It can be used to deallocate memory or clean up.
    Make sure to wrap the method with the `@stop_module` decorator from the
    `Module` class.
