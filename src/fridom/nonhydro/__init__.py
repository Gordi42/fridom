A 3D non-hydrostatic Boussinesq model.

Description
-----------
The model is based on the ps3D model by Prof. Carsten Eden 
( https://github.com/ceden/ps3D ).

System of Equations
-------------------
The model solves the scaled non-hydrostatic Boussinesq equations given by 
the momentum equations:

.. math::
    \partial_t u + Ro~\, \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla u =
        f v - \partial_x p + \boldsymbol{F}_u

.. math::
    \partial_t v + Ro~\, \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla v =
        -f u - \partial_y p + \boldsymbol{F}_v

.. math::
    \partial_t w + Ro~\, \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla w =
        - \delta^{-2} b - \delta^{-2} \partial_z p + \boldsymbol{F}_w

The buoyancy equation:

.. math::
    \partial_t b + Ro~, \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla b = -w N^2 + \boldsymbol{F}_b

And the continuity equation:

.. math::
    \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = 0

with:
    - :math:`\boldsymbol{u} = (u, v, w)` the velocity vector,
    - :math:`p` the model pressure,
    - :math:`b` the model buoyancy,
    - :math:`f` the Coriolis parameter,
    - :math:`N` the buoyancy frequency,
    - :math:`\boldsymbol{F}_i` are sources and sinks,
    - :math:`Ro` the Rossby number (1 for unscaled equations),
    - :math:`\delta` the aspect ratio (1 for unscaled equations),

Meaning of Pressure and Buoyancy
--------------------------------
TL;DR:

- The model pressure :math:`p` is defined as:

    .. math::
        p = \frac{\pi - \pi_s}{\rho_0}

    where :math:`\pi` is the real pressure, and :math:`\pi_s` is the hydrostatic
    background pressure. 
- The model buoyancy :math:`b` is defined as:

    .. math::
        b = -\frac{g}{\rho_0} \rho'

    where :math:`\rho'` is the density perturbation, and :math:`\rho_0` is the
    constant Boussinesq density.
- The buoyancy frequency :math:`N` is defined as:

    .. math::
        N^2 = -\frac{g}{\rho_0} \partial_z \rho_s = \partial_z b_s

    where :math:`\rho_s` is the background density profile.

Let :math:`\rho` be the real density (the one that we would measure in a
real fluid), and :math:`\pi` be the real pressure. In this section, we
link the model pressure :math:`p`, the model buoyancy :math:`b`, and the
buoyancy frequency :math:`N` to the real pressure and density. For that,
we start with the full Boussinesq equations (neglect scaling and source terms):

.. math::
    \rho_0 (D_t u - fv) = - \partial_x \pi
    ~ , \quad
    \rho_0 (D_t v + fu) = - \partial_y \pi
    ~ , \quad
    \rho_0 D_t w = - \partial_z \pi - \rho g

where :math:`D_t = \partial_t + \boldsymbol{u} \cdot \nabla` is the material
derivative, :math:`\rho_0` is the constant Boussinesq density. We further 
decompose the density into a part that only depends on the vertical coordinate
:math:`\rho_s(z)`, and a perturbation :math:`\rho'`:

.. math::
    \rho(\boldsymbol{x}, t) = \rho_0 + \rho_s(z) + \rho'(\boldsymbol{x}, t)

We now solve the vertical momentum equation for :math:`w=0`, and :math:`\rho' = 0`:

.. math::
    \partial_z \pi_s = - g \rho_0 - g \rho_s(z)

where :math:`\pi_s` is the hydrostatic background pressure. Defining the
pressure :math:`p`, and buoyancy :math:`b` as:

.. math::
    p = \frac{\pi - \pi_s}{\rho_0}
    ~ , \quad
    b = -\frac{\rho' g}{\rho_0}

the Boussinesq equations become:

.. math::
    D_t u - fv = - \partial_x p
    ~ , \quad
    D_t v + fu = - \partial_y p
    ~ , \quad
    D_t w = - \partial_z p + b
    

To obtain a tendency equation for the buoyancy, we compute its differential:

.. math::
    db = - \frac{g}{\rho_0} d\rho' = - \frac{g}{\rho_0} d\rho + \frac{g}{\rho_0} d\rho_s
       = - \frac{g}{\rho_0} d\rho - N^2 dz

where the buoyancy frequency :math:`N` is defined as:

.. math::
    N^2 = - \frac{g}{\rho_0} \partial_z \rho_s = \partial_z b_s

Divide the differential by :math:`dt` to obtain the tendency equation:

.. math::
    D_t b = - \frac{g}{\rho_0} D_t \rho - N^2 w

By further assuming that the density is conserved, we obtain the buoyancy equation:

.. math::
    D_t b = - w N^2


Scaling
-------
The system is nondimensionalized by introducing the following nondimensional
coordinates:

.. math::
    x' = \frac{x}{L}
    ~ , \quad
    y' = \frac{y}{L}
    ~ , \quad
    z' = \frac{z}{H}
    ~ , \quad
    t' = \Omega t

where :math:`L` is the horizontal length scale, :math:`H` is the vertical length
scale, and :math:`\Omega` is the rotation rate. The nondimensional variables are
alwqays denoted with the prime. The nondimensional model parameters are:

.. math::
    f' = \frac{f}{\Omega}
    ~ , \quad
    N' = \frac{N}{N^*}

where :math:`N^*` is the order of magnitude of the buoyancy frequency.
The nondimensional model variables are:

.. math::
    u' = \frac{u}{U}
    ~ , \quad
    v' = \frac{v}{U}
    ~ , \quad
    w' = \frac{w}{W}
    ~ , \quad
    p' = \frac{p}{P}
    ~ , \quad
    b' = \frac{b}{B}

where :math:`U` is the order of magnitude of the horizontal velocity, :math:`W`
is the order of magnitude of the vertical velocity, :math:`P` is the order of
magnitude of the pressure, and :math:`B` is the order of magnitude of the
buoyancy. We define the scaling parameters as follows:

.. math::
    Ro = \frac{U}{\Omega L}
    ~ , \quad
    \delta = \frac{H}{L}
    ~ , \quad
    L_r = \frac{N^* H}{\Omega}

where :math:`Ro` is the Rossby number, :math:`\delta` is the aspect ratio, and
:math:`L_r` is the Rossby deformation radius. Inserting the nondimensional
variables into the continuity equation, we obtain the following scaling relation
for the aspect ratio:

.. math::
    \delta = \frac{H}{L} = \frac{W}{U}

We assume a small Rossby number and that the momentum equations are in balance (e.g. the time derivatives 
vanish). This leads to the following scaling relation:

.. math::
    B = \Omega U = \frac{P}{L}

We further assume that the length scale is of the same order of magnitude as the
Rossby deformation radius. Or in other words, a Froude number of order one. From
this assumption, we can relate the buoyancy frequency to the rotation rate and
the aspect ratio:

.. math::
    L \approx L_r \Rightarrow N^* = \frac{\Omega}{\delta}

Inserting everything into the full Boussinesq equations, we obtain the scaled
equations that are given at the beginning.


Time Stepping
-------------
We recall that the full system of equations is given by (neglecting scaling):

.. math::
    \partial_t \boldsymbol{u} = \Delta_{\boldsymbol{u}} - \nabla p
    ~ , \quad
    \partial_t b = \Delta_b
    ~ , \quad
    \nabla \cdot \boldsymbol{u} = 0

where :math:`\Delta_{\boldsymbol{u}}` includes all tendency terms on the right
hand side of the momentum equations except the pressure gradient term. And 
the same for :math:`\Delta_b`. Taking the divergence of the momentum equations,
we obtain the Poisson equation for the pressure:

.. math::
    \nabla^2 p = \nabla \cdot \Delta_{\boldsymbol{u}}

This means that the pressure is implicitly given by the velocity and buoyancy.
Hence, the full system of equations can be written as:

.. math::
    \partial_t \boldsymbol{z} = \boldsymbol{f}(\boldsymbol{z}, t)

where :math:`\boldsymbol{z} = (\boldsymbol{u}, b)` is the state vector, and 
:math:`\boldsymbol{f}` is the right hand side of the equations. For the explicit
time stepping schemes, we must evaluate the right hand side of the equations at
a given time level. This is done by first computing the tendency terms
:math:`\Delta_{\boldsymbol{u}}` and :math:`\Delta_b`, and then solving the
Poisson equation for the pressure. And finally, we remove the pressure gradient
term from the tendency terms to obtain the right hand side of the equations.
