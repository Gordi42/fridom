"""
Framework for Idealized Ocean Models (FRIDOM)
=============================================

Description
-----------
FRIDOM is a modeling framework designed with a singular goal in mind: 
to provide a high-level interface for the development of idealized ocean models. 
FRIDOM leverages the power of CUDA arrays on GPU through CuPy, enabling the 
execution of models at medium resolutions, constrained only by your hardware 
capabilities, right within Jupyter Notebook.

For more information, visit the project's GitHub repository:
